## Event Sponsorship Coordination Checklist

### Event Evaluation

- [ ] Verification that the event is organized by the Open Foundation, or justification for moving forward with another event that may have less developer reach.

- [ ] Contact the [open source lead](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/opensource/connect/community/) to gain approval for sponsoring the event.

- [ ] Obtain a sponsorship prostpectus from the event producer. The call-for-sponsors is often 3-6 months prior to the event. The event site will provide details on the sponsorship opportunities or a contact to obtain the sponsorship prospectus. 

- [ ] Evaluate the appropriate sponsorship level: Top Level: sually includes main stage presence and a large booth in the expo. For large events, this level requires several resources dedicated to execution and often a contract with an external agency approved by IBM. Medium Level: usually includes a sponsored breakout session and a medium size booth in the expo.  For large events, this level requires several resources dedicated to execution.

- [ ] Engage the local IBM marketing team for help with contract signature and required paperwork. See the Contract Signature section for details.

### Event Planning

- [ ] Identify the [Developer Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/code/patterns/) to feature at the IBM Booth. 

- [ ] Submit a [speaking proposal](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/programs/opentech/) on the event call-for-papers featuring the Pattern(s)

- [ ] Plan for Developer Advocates to attend the event to present the Pattern(s) and promote [developer.ibm.com/code](http://developer.ibm.com/code). Track their attendance (currently in Wrike). 

- [ ] Identify the appropriate IBM Offering(s) to feature and request SME's to support the IBM booth. 

- [ ] If the sponsorship includes a keynote or sponsored session, contact the [open source lead](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/opensource/connect/community/) to plan the content and identify the speaker. 

### Event Execution

- [ ] Handle the show producer deliverables and deadlines. Examples include: description for event sponsor page, marketing slide, videos, artwork for the booth backdrop, keynote or sponsored sessions abstract and speakers' info.

- [ ] Order furniture, monitors, and lead tracking devices for the booth from the agency identified by the show producer. Dedicate a station/monitor to promote the pattern(s) and developer.ibm.com, dedicate a station/monitor to promote IBM Offerings or other content, and order multiple lead tracking devices per station/monitor. Marketing compaign managers will want to have access to separate leads. 

- [ ] Define the schedule for demos and staff during the expo hours. Ensure adequate staffing during peak hours. See the below booth schedule example. 

- [ ] Plan for a giveaway branded with developer.ibm.com when possible. To find your supplier for customized IBM Logo merchandise visit [www.logostore-globali.com](http:www.logostore-globali.com). These are the only providers you are authorized to use. You will be required to obtain approval from IBM branding by submitting a Logo Merchandize request [here](https://prdpcrhibmbl01.w3-969.ibm.com/marketing/logotool/logotool.nsf/frmMerchlogo?OpenForm). In addition you will have to request CTEBA approval for the amenities provided at the event (t-shirts, gadgets, event stickers). Engage the local IBM marketing team for help with the required paperwork. See the CTEBA approval for giveaways section below. 

- [ ] Plan for a fun activity at the booth to attract a crowd. Some examples are: TJBot, developer office hours for available speakers, engineers or developers, the IBM Cloud server VR challenge, book signing, etc. 

- [ ] Ensure that the IBM team attending the event is well-informed. Distribute a guidance document summarizing the IBM presence at the event, information on IBM's contribution to the Open Technology, recent revelant announcement and logistical details about the event. See this [guidance document example](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vqk0fvmbex2ufibxqnmsrcl0qmfdvptf)

### Event Promotion

- [ ] Promote [developer.ibm.com/code](http://developer.ibm.com) with the following assets: [IBM Code business card handout](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/50zyo9ky6fpanodt8ip0aphndffocvuw), [IBM Code video](https://ibm.box.com/s/93tktpt4etyb2ry72spgxi8ifxabhube0), and [IBM Developer Outreach Program retractable banner](https://ibm.box.com/s/oxs233pbg61duogmt4mqvlirbj199t1i)

#### Contract Signature

Contract signature and payment to show producers is obtained via a 3rd party contractor called George P. Johnson (GPJ). IBM employees cannot sign a contract.

- [ ] Submit pre-approval on [EPA](https://epa.w3bmix.ibm.com/). You'll be notified when your pre-approval is approved. 

- [ ] When approval is obtained, you can open a PO in [bond](https://w3.ibm.com/procurement/buyondemand/common/protect/Connector.wss) for "GPJ Sponsorship"

- [ ] Create an Event Marketing Brief (EMB) in the Marketing Event Tool. Training is required to get access to the tool. 

- [ ] Submit a "3rd party requests for use of the IBM logo" request to authorize the show producer to use the IBM Logo to promote the sponsorship on the [IBM Branding site](https://prdpcrhibmbl01.w3-969.ibm.com/marketing/logotool/logotool.nsf/BrandingLogoHome)

- [ ] Contact GPJ at "IBM Space and Sponsorship" space&spon@gpj.com providing the following information to initiate legal review and signature of the contract: Event name, location, and date. Event producer contact. Contract. EMB Reference ID. Logo request ID

#### CTEBA Approval for giveaways

If you plan to provide giveaways at the event, you need to obtain CTEBA approval by filling out the CTEBA amenities tab in the Event Marketing Brief (EMB). Request an estimate from the IBM-authorized provider and calculate the value per each item. Create an amenity for each item you will provide (t-shirt, gadget, etc). Submit the CTEBA section of the EMB. 

After the event ensure you "set the actuals" for the CTEBA amenities by calculating the exact value of each giveway, including taxes.
